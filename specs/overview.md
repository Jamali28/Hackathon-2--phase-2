# Project Overview: Todo Full-Stack Web App (Phase II)

## Purpose
The primary goal of Phase II is to transform the existing Phase I console application into a modern, multi-user, production-ready SaaS Todo platform. This phase focuses on delivering a premium user experience, secure authentication, and robust data persistence.

## Design System

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: `blue-600` (#2563eb) - Used for primary actions, branding, and focus states.
- **Success**: `green-600` (#16a34a) - Used for completed tasks, success notifications, and positive states.
- **Error**: `red-600` (#dc2626) - Used for destructive actions, error states, and high-priority alerts.
- **Background**: `white` (Light) / `gray-900` (Dark).
- **Surface**: `gray-50` (Light) / `gray-800` (Dark).

### Typography
- **Primary Font**: Inter (Sans-serif) - Clean, modern, and highly legible.
- **Heading Scale**: Consistent hierarchy from H1 to H4.
- **Weight**: Normal (400), Medium (500), Semi-bold (600).

### Spacing & Layout
- **Grid System**: 4px base (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64).
- **Shadows**: Subtle, layered shadows for depth (Soft UI).
- **Rounding**: `rounded-lg` (8px) for cards and inputs, `rounded-full` for badges.

## UI Principles
- **Minimalist**: Focus on the task at hand; remove unnecessary clutter.
- **Professional**: High-quality finish with smooth transitions and consistent styling.
- **Fast**: Optimized for performance and instant visual feedback.
- **Accessible**: ARIA-compliant, keyboard navigable, and high contrast.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 16+ (App Router), TypeScript.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3.4+ with `tailwind-dark` plugin.
- **State/Data**: Server Components by default; Client Components for interactivity.
