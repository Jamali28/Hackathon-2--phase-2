# Initial Setup Implementation Plan

## Tech Stack
- Node.js/JavaScript for backend services
- Next.js for frontend application
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- PostgreSQL for database
- FastAPI for backend APIs
- Better Auth for authentication

## Architecture
The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and shared utilities.

## File Structure
```
project/
├── backend/
├── frontend/
├── specs/
├── history/
└── .specify/
```

## Implementation Approach
1. Set up basic project structure
2. Configure development environment
3. Implement core functionality
4. Add testing and validation
5. Deploy and monitor

## Risk Assessment
- Compatibility issues between different script environments
- Missing dependencies or configurations
- Integration problems with existing tooling
