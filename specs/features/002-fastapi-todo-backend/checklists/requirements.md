# Specification Quality Checklist: FastAPI Todo Backend

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-07
**Feature**: [specs/features/002-fastapi-todo-backend/spec.md](specs/features/002-fastapi-todo-backend/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - *Note: While the prompt mentions FastAPI/Neon, the spec focuses on user value and behaviors.*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The specification is derived from a highly technical prompt, but the resulting spec describes the behavior and security requirements from a functional perspective.
- Ready for implementation planning.
