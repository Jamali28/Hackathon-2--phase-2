## Prompt

<command-message>sp.tasks</command-message>
<command-name>/sp.tasks</command-name>

[... Reference to plan and specs ...]

## Response snapshot

I have generated a structured task list at `specs/features/001-premium-frontend-design/tasks.md`. The tasks are organized into 5 phases: Setup, Foundational, User Story 1 (Auth), User Story 2 (Task Management), and Polish. Each task follows the mandatory markdown checkbox format with IDs, priority labels, and story identifiers.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Provided a granular, executable roadmap for specialists to implement the frontend.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created specs/features/001-premium-frontend-design/tasks.md.
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks are small, independent, and contain specific file paths, following SDD best practices.
