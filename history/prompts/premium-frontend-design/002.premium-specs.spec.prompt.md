## Prompt

The current goal is to create detailed, professional frontend specifications that will produce a **beautiful, modern, error-free UI** for the Todo app. The final frontend must look like a production-ready SaaS application.

Invoke @agents/spec-writer.md to write the following frontend specification files with **premium quality focus**. Output one complete file at a time, clearly labeled.

[... List of 6 specification files and criteria ...]

## Response snapshot

I have generated a comprehensive suite of 6 premium frontend specification files and a quality checklist. The specifications define a professional design system (Inter font, 4px grid, blue/green/red palette), atomic architecture, and detailed requirements for authentication, task management, page layouts, and a component library. All files include dark mode support and emphasize accessibility and performance.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established high-fidelity UI/UX standards for the Phase II implementation.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created 6 specifications + 1 checklist across /specs/ and /specs/ui/.
- 🧠 Reflection: The specifications are ready for the orchestrator to begin implementation planning.
